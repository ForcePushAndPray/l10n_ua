"""Rows of the material report as records fit to be browsed.

The PDF prints the form as it is, but people also work with it: they look up
a product, check a category, narrow down to a single storage place, fold it
into totals. So the very rows that go to print are materialized here and shown
in two modes — List (with the category and storage place panels on the left,
like the standard Inventory report) and Pivot table.

A row is "product + storage place + month", not a product alone: the store a
person is in charge of usually consists of several places, and the same
product yields as many rows as the places it sat in. The period, in turn, is
cut into calendar months, so over a quarter the same product in the same place
yields three rows — and that is what the monthly statistics in the pivot table
are built from.

A row's `date_from` is the start of its month (clipped by the period bounds in
the edge months), so grouping by `date_from:month` gives exactly the months of
the report.

These same records are what gets printed: the printed form is built from them
rather than recomputing the report, which is why the filters on screen reach
the paper too.

This is a snapshot of a period, not accounting data: the values are written
once when the report is built and are deliberately not related fields of the
product, so that a later change of its category or price cannot rewrite a
report that has already been produced. The records live exactly as long as the
wizard that produced them.
